"""
input:
    angle: [degree]:
        positive: it moves clockwise in plane (x,z) with respect to the center.
        negative: it moves counterclockwise in plane (x,z) with respect to the center.
    
    center_x, center_z: coordinates of the center (center of line between the shoulder).

    point_x, point_z: coordinates of the point that we want to rotate.

    it return only the x coordinated since we don't need the z and y it's the same (don't change).
